Hi Kurt,
    You can use 


Option 1:
--------------

Extract a single band out of the image as follows:

imageMath.py –e='a_1' --a=filt_topophase.unw.geo –o phase.geo –t FLOAT

Then you can use xyz2grd on this. You will have to supply geocoding information in command line.


Option 2:
-------------

I personally prefer using gdal  instead of GMT as it has no support for multi-band images or complex data (making GMT mostly cumbersome for dealing with InSAR and stacks of interferograms):

(Write an ENVI header for an ISCE product)
isce2gis.py envi –I filt_topophase.unw.geo

(Use gdal to translate it to GMT)
gdal_translate –of GMT –b 2 –ot Float32 filt_topophase.unw.geo phase.grd

The geocoding information is already included in the generated grd by gdal.

Subject: GMT script for reading BIL format for interferograms

Hi Piyush,

I am trying to read interferograms with names like the following.

20111213_20111107/filt_topophase.unw.geo
20111213_20111107/filt_topophase.unw.geo.xml

Do you have an example of a GMT script using xyz2grd -b to read them? I cannot figure out how to read every other 4-byte float to obtain just the (unwrapped) phase values. 

Thanks,

Kurt

I could not find the answer on the web because the examples are from DEMs that do not interleave two bands.
